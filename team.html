                        <span>‚Äú</span>Closing Bear has been a wonderful resource for me as a realtor! Chip Lynn and his team are always available to answer questions and provide information. Chip has been been instrumental in solving problems in order to help several of my sellers close on their properties. When it comes to closings- you can count on Closing Bear for a professional and fun atmosphere! ‚ÄîLisa Sheets Stone <br><br>Chip and the team are extremely professional and I can close my clients with them in total confidence of a job well done. During the closing there is never a dull moment, Chip Lynn does a great job of taking the edge off and making it fun!‚Äù ‚ÄîKaren Wentz<br><br>‚ÄùClosing Bear makes the closing process enjoyable opposed to dreadful. Their processors behind the scenes are amazing. Getting the job done in a remarkable time frame and keeping the customer up to date on what is happening the entire way. And what can I say about Chip Lynn, He definitely makes the closing interesting. So friendly and engaging. Puts the customers at ease. I have been to some closings that were so cold and sterile and the customer walks out not knowing what they are supposed to do next. With Closing Bear the customer is well informed. üòÄüòÇ. ‚Äú ‚ÄîDoreen Hock-Congdon <span>‚Äù</span>

                    <p>Thank you for giving Closing Bear a look. My hope is that you can see we are not like any other title company around. My dad is a general contractor, and I grew up on job sites building houses. Then I went to law school and focused on real estate and business. I have seen real estate from every angle there is, and am backed by the largest title insurance company in the world. This is not a law firm that added a title company, nor a title company that has a law firm on the side. The ONLY business I am in is closing your deal. My goal is that you find the process of buying and selling property stress free and FUN. My personal email and cell phone are listed in the contact section, and you have an open invitation to contact me directly with any questions, or any way you think we can improve as a company. </p>
